# LeDesign Port Configuration

Development server runs on PORT 4000 (not 3000)

This is configured in:
- apps/web/package.json (dev and start scripts use -p 4000)
- Documented in README.md, CLAUDE.md, and QUICK_START.md

URL: http://localhost:4000

Reason: Port 3000 is used by other projects on this machine.
