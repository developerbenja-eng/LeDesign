## Narrative Themes Collected

### 1. THE FRAGMENTATION PROBLEM (Extended Version)

**Traditional Stack Reality**:
- HEC-RAS + EPANET (Hidráulica)
- Civil 3D (Diseño Vial)
- RAM Elements + ETABS (Estructural)
- Word + Excel (Memorias - Manual)

**Pain Points**:
- ❌ Duplicate data across 4-5 different programs
- ❌ Excel macros nobody understands
- ❌ Disconnected calculation reports
- ❌ Copy-pasted details from old projects
- ❌ Hours lost migrating between proprietary formats
- ❌ Human errors from manual data copying

**Why This Happens**:
- Global companies (Autodesk, Bentley, USACE) dominate with proprietary formats
- Massive infrastructure, slow evolution
- Designed for global markets, not Chile
- Result: Each company creates its own standards (or none), wasting time on every project

### 2. THE CHILEAN CONTEXT (Unique Angle)

**Chilean Norms**:
- ✓ NCh433 (seismic design)
- ✓ NCh691 (stormwater design)
- ✓ MOP Highway Manuals
- ✓ DOM, SERVIU, MOP review systems

**The Reality**:
- ❌ Civil 3D is powerful, but how do you adapt it to MOP details?
- ❌ Where is DGA data integrated with HEC-RAS?
- ❌ Who connects fluviometric stations with hydraulic models?
- ❌ How do you generate EETTs in DOM format?

**Key Quote**:
> "When I worked in Chile as an engineer, it wasn't a lack of capable engineers. It was the lack of a platform that connected everything."

---

### 3. THE MODERN AI OPPORTUNITY

**Before** (Traditional Software):
- Only large companies could build enterprise-level software
- Autodesk, Bentley, Trimble invested decades and billions
- Massive infrastructure, difficult to change
- Designed for all markets = optimized for none
- Slow development cycles

**Now** (AI-Powered Era):
- Small companies can create enterprise-level solutions using modern AI (Gemini, GPT-4)
- Cloud scalable infrastructure
- ✓ Modern, agile infrastructure
- ✓ 100% designed for Chile
- ✓ Feedback → Features in days, not years

**Our Competitive Advantages**:
1. **We Know Chile** - Not trying to serve all markets
2. **We Lived the Problem** - Built it because we needed it
3. **Fast Movement** - Adapt to real feedback in days, no corporate bureaucracy
