## 💡 Content Highlights

### Slide 1: Hook
Global engineering tools cost $25,000/year but don't understand Chilean norms (NCh), DGA data, or MOP formats.

### Slide 2: Fragmentation Problem
Civil 3D, HEC-RAS, ETABS, Word/Excel - 4 programs that don't communicate. Result: 40 hours wasted per project on manual work.

### Slide 3: The Chilean Gap
Chile has unique requirements (NCh433 seismic, DGA hydrology, MOP highways, DOM permits) that global tools don't integrate.

### Slide 4: AI Breakthrough
Before: Only giants like Autodesk could build engineering software.
Now: Small teams + modern AI can create enterprise platforms 100% for Chile, with features in days not years.

### Slide 5: LeDesign Solution
All 5 engineering modules integrated with 30+ Chilean data sources. Automatic reports in 30 seconds. One programmatic, collaborative platform.

### Slide 6: Cost Revolution
Traditional stack: $25K-$46K/year
LeDesign: $1,200/year
Savings: 95-97% = $40K+ recovered annually

### Slide 7: Time Transformation
From 40 hours to 2 hours per project (95% time saved). Automatic data loading from IDE Chile, instant reports, specifications ready in minutes.

### Slide 8: The Vision
Future: Start projects from phone in field, instant DEM and satellite data, real-time collaboration. Built by Chilean engineers for Chilean engineers.

### Slide 9: Call to Action
Join 2,500+ Chilean engineers designing faster. 50% discount first 3 months. ledesign.cl
